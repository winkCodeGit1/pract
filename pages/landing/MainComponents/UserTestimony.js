            Great medical office, wonderful and warm experience from start to finish. Appreciate Dr.
            Ravikant taking time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options. Was
            referred over by my general doctor and can see why. Highly recommended.

            Dr. Salma did a great job with my first ever health exam. She explained everything to me
            in a very clear manner. She was also kind and friendly. All of the staff was great â€“
            they were helpful, patient and helped with my insurance.

            Wonderful experience. Dr. Mallik was a wonderful surgeon, and the staff was always
            helpful and kind. They ensured I had a smooth prep, surgery, and follow-up. I am so glad
            I chose it and would highly recommend to anyone.
